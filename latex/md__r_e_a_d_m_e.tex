\subsection*{Synopsis}

This project is a base for creating sprite based top down 2d games using the Qt c++ framework

\subsection*{Motivation}

C++ is a relatively \char`\"{}old\char`\"{} language, but it is still often the first real strong typed procedural language that students encounter in computer science. Most c++ projects in even modern textbooks are geared to console or command line programming. This project has a goal of providing a code base for gui programming. It is built using the Qt 5 framework.

\subsection*{Installation}

T\+BD

Will Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

\subsection*{A\+PI Reference}

T\+BD

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the R\+E\+A\+D\+ME. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the A\+PI reference docs live.

\subsection*{Tests}

T\+BD Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
