# Sprite Walker


## Synopsis

This project is a base for creating sprite based top down 2d games using the Qt c++ framework


## Motivation


C++ is a relatively "old" language, but it is still often the first real strong typeed procedural language that students encounter in computer science.  Most c++ projects in even modern textbooks are geared to console or command line programming.  This project has a goal of providing a code base for gui programming.  It is built using the Qt 5 framework.

## Installation

TBD

Will Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

TBD

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

TBD
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Code Examples

TBD
